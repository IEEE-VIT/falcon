# Falcon Tracking & Surveillance

## Overview
___
This app aims to tackle the spread of **COVID-19** by warning users of any past interactons they might have had with an infected patient, thus making users aware of the possiblity that they might have contracted the virus too.

Falcon was built using anonymity in mind. Users are asked to sign in anonymously without providing any personal details to keep their identity safe. The app constantly tracks your location and stores it on your device. If an user contracts the virus, they can report this to the app, sending out an alert to everyone else who might have interacted or come close to the infected user. (Your location data is pushed to the cloud if you report yourself to the app.)

Along with this, our app displays visual indicators on a map to help you better understand the spread of Corona Virus in your community/locality. It also provides visual *hot zones*, where the spread of Corona Virus has been widespread.

To keep users informed, we also have live statistics about COVID-19 as well as related news and tips.
